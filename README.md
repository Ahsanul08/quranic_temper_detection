# quranic_temper_detection

A thesis work of mine, which parses arabic text from webpage based on given url and check them against quranic verses. The project then decides the text is either exact or tempered copy from any verse of Holy quran, or not a quranic verse at all.  


To run this project, please install the needed dependencies and run `python UIhandler.py`
